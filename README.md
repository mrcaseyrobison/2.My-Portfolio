Challenge 2: Portfolio Page 

GitHub Page: https://mrcaseyrobison.github.io/2.My-Portfolio/

+ Fully (hopefully) responsive portfolio. 
+ Since I have no web apps at the moment, I styled the portfolio page using travel photos as placeholders for forthcoming web apps (obviously the hover text will change as the portfolio changes.)
+ The navigation links (both in the header and footer) are functional and open to a new tab in the browser (a href target="blank").
+ Media queries were tricky and took some tweaking, particularly when trying to optimize it for my iPhone 13 Pro Max. I did not optimize it for screens smaller than the 13 Pro Max because I don't have any screens that small and thus, could not test for it. But I *think* it should work. All other responsive screen optimizations work on my end. 
+ Since 'IMPACT' font doesn't exist on iOS I reset the font-family on the iPhone query to Courier / Monospace. It's not as aesthetically pleasing as Impact (personally) but it functions. 
+ Lots of "tweaks" in the repo history--that illustrates every *little* change I made to troubleshoot the iPhone optimization. LOL.
