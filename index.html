          <h2 id="about">About Me:</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Seattle WA, I have spent the majority of my career in the liquor and hospitality business. From 2008 - 2018 I was the beverage director for Heavy Restaraunt Group where I designed, coordinated, and opened numerous bar programs for new concepts around Seattle and on the Eastside. Mentoring younger bartenders has always been a passion of mine and my experience with Heavy allowed me to pursue that passion.</p>
            <p>In 2018 I left Heavy to pursue a role in spirits marketing with Pernod Ricard, where I was a Key Account Manager for their New Brand Ventures portfolio in the Seattle area. It was a great experience that was unfortunately cut short by a global pandemic.</p>
           <p>While working at Pernod Ricard I also went back to school. I got my Associate of Arts degree from Seattle Central and in 2020 matriculated to the University of Washington where I pursued a degree in History. I completed my degree in 2022. I am forever grateful to my experience at the UW.</p>           
            <p>As an avid traveler and amatuer photographer, I am using this space to showcase just a handful of photos from my travels. These photos are placeholders for forthcoming web projects.</p>
